    <h2>A weeekend on the seine</h2>
     <p>I was lucky enough to spend three days in Paris this month! I went with my friend and we were able to see many things while we were there</p>
     <h4>

        <h1 id="Day1">Day1</h1>
         <p> On our first day, we started by visiting <em>Montmartre</em> right away. Our second stop was the Eiffel Tower (check out that beautiful picture!) We ate dinner at a cute little bistro overlooking <em>la seine</em>.</p>
        <h1 id="Day2">Day2</h1>
         <p>On our second day, we went shopping on <em>Avenue des Champss Elysees</em>. Every single person we saw dressed in height of fashion.<br>After visited some really beatiful places! We went to <em>Notre Dame</em>. We went on a macaron tour of paris and ate all of the best marcarons the city had to offer. After we finished shopping, we visited <em>le Louvre</em>.</p>
        <h1 id="Day3">Day3</h1>
        <p>The picture below is of me visiting the <em>Arc de Triompe</em>. It's huge! We also went to <em>le Musee D'Orsay</em>. Seeing the work of Renoir, Monet, And Van Gogh in person was completely breathtaking. I was surprised to see that the museum also had man sculptures including thoses by Augeste Rodin, Paul Gauguin, and Alfred Barye.</p>
